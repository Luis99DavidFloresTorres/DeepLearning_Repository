# DeepLearning_Repository
All the code here have models and the pre process.
Review the branch master for the code

# What is CEPI? 
Cepi is a enterprise that sell postgrade courses.
Did a model that predict a student from the courses characteristics (finish)
link cepi https://posgrado.usfx.bo/ 
Worked with real dataset.
# In Process
Chatbot for CEPI using LLM with different techniques train like:
Adapters.
LoRa.
Retrain all the model with different outputs


# Reasons for use different techniques.
Task: Chatbot recommendation, classification if a student is interested on a course if is do a query to the database for a real time data(because the course is update every moment have new courses)
Think that we can leverage the weights of the model, instead use 2 models. Because we dont have many data to use, and is in the same context thats why we can leverage this.
